The South-Western region of Nigeria, often referred to simply as the South-West, occupies a prime location within the country. Situated in the southern part of Nigeria, this region is bounded by the Benin Republic to the west, the Republic of Togo to the west, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south. It shares its northern borders with the neighboring South-South region and the North-Central region of Nigeria. The South-West comprises six states, namely Lagos, Ogun, Oyo, Osun, Ondo, and Ekiti. This strategic location provides access to both domestic and international trade routes through its extensive coastline along the Gulf of Guinea. This geographic positioning has historically made the South-West a vital center for commerce and cultural exchange. This geographical significance has not only influenced the economic activities of the region but has also shaped its cultural identity.
